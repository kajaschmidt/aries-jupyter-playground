When a user’s client software is preparing a transaction for submission to the network, it must include a demonstration that the user had the opportunity to review the current TAA and accept it. This is done by including some additional fields in the ledger write transaction: \n",
    "\n",
    "* A hash of the agreement\n",
    "* A date when the agreement was accepted, and\n",
    "* A string indicating the user interaction that was followed to obtain the acceptance.\n",
